I am currently a 4th year PhD student in the Center for Biophysics & Quantitative Biology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) where I work in the [Shukla group](https://shuklagroup.org/). Prior to attenting UIUC I completed my Bachelor of Science in Biochemistry at Virginia Tech where I worked in the [Lemkul lab](https://www.thelemkullab.com/) as an undergraduate researcher.

My primary research interest lies in the development of machine learning methods for ligand prediction and the application of computational chemistry techniques for synthetic data generation. This work is currently being targeted towards plant proteins where very little experimental data is available.
