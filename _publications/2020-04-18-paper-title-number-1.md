excerpt: 'G-quadruplexes (GQs) are nucleic acid structures critical for gene regulation and genomic stability, making them promising drug targets for diseases like leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Using molecular dynamics simulations with nonpolarizable and polarizable force fields, we highlighted the importance of ion interactions, base substitutions, and structural dynamics in GQ stability, providing insights to guide the development of GQ-targeting therapeutics and importance of polarizability in modelling these structures.'
