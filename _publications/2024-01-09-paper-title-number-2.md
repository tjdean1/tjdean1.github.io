excerpt: 'Striga Hermothica is a parasitic plant which costs agriculture billions of dollars per year. It perceives host plants via ShHTL7, an enzyme which binds to plant hormones named strigolactones. Using umbrella sampling, we explain the structural cause of the heightened sensitivity over ShHTL6 and host plant protein OsD3.'
